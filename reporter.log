1697437409.947527	Reporter::WARNING	The analyzed trace file was determined to contain only TCP control packets, which may indicate it's been pre-filtered.  By default, Zeek reports the missing segments for this type of trace, but the 'detect_filtered_trace' option may be toggled if that's not desired.	/opt/zeek/share/zeek/base/misc/find-filtered-trace.zeek, line 69
